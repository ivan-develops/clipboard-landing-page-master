## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It's a best practice to use `div` containers for information. Sometimes it's not optimal to have everything limited by a `section` and control everything with margin, padding, max-width, or flex-box.
